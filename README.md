Client / Server side code in java to generate a simple output of a random song/artist/date from the command prompt given a specific IP from AWS, given an input of a given year.
Utilizing AWS, virtualization and containers. I had roughly 5 days to complete this project and fully set up the virtual machine in AWS to facilitate the server side for this program.
The program experienced many bugs trying to retrieve from the dataset. However, after incorporating simple invariants to prevent file errors these issues were resolved and the program runs
correctly.

Project made for Victoria University of Wellington NWEN243
